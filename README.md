# 🫀 Heart Failure Prediction Web App

This project is part of the **DevTown Predictive Modelling Bootcamp**, where we trained a machine learning model to predict the risk of death due to heart failure and deployed it using **Flask** with a clean **custom CSS frontend**.

## 💡 Overview

- 📊 **Dataset**: Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset
- 🧠 **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- 🎯 **Goal**: Predict whether a patient is likely to die based on clinical inputs.
- 🌐 **Deployment**: Flask web app with custom HTML and CSS UI
